            <h2>Why luxury design matters</h2>
            <p class="sub">
              People decide how they feel about your brand in seconds. A premium website makes that first impression
              intentional — clear, confident, and trustworthy.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="grid2">
          <div class="tile reveal">
            <span class="badge">Perception</span>
            <h3 style="margin:10px 0 6px;">Premium look = premium trust</h3>
            <p style="margin:0; color:var(--muted);">
              A luxury theme isn’t just gold accents and dark backgrounds. It’s the feeling of structure: generous
              spacing, calm typography, clean animations, and a consistent tone. When your design is composed, your
              audience assumes your service is composed too. That’s the psychological advantage of a strong digital
              presence: it creates belief before a conversation even starts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="tile reveal">
            <span class="badge">Clarity</span>
            <h3 style="margin:10px 0 6px;">Luxury is also simplicity</h3>
            <p style="margin:0; color:var(--muted);">
              A common mistake is stuffing a homepage with everything at once. Luxury websites do the opposite: they
              guide attention. Visitors should instantly understand what you do, who it’s for, and what to do next.
              That’s why this site structure is conversion-focused — strong headings, short decisions, and clear calls
              to action that feel natural rather than pushy.
            </p>

  <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px;">Websites built with intention</h3>

  <p style="margin:0; color:var(--muted);">
    A good website doesn’t try to impress everyone—it speaks clearly to the right audience. It guides attention,
    removes doubt, and makes it easy for people to take the next step. When structure, visuals, and message are
    aligned, your website stops being decoration and starts working as part of your business.
  </p>

  <p style="color:var(--muted);">
    Manuel Studios focuses on building clean, modern websites that feel confident and professional. Every layout is
    designed with purpose: clear sections, balanced spacing, and a visual flow that feels calm and easy to follow.
    Nothing is added without reason, and nothing important is hidden or overcomplicated.
  </p>

  <p style="color:var(--muted);">
    Strong design is about clarity, not noise. Visitors should instantly understand what you do, who it’s for, and
    how to get in touch. That’s why each page is structured to guide users naturally—from first impression to enquiry—
    without friction or confusion.
  </p>

  <p style="color:var(--muted);">
    Performance matters just as much as appearance. Pages are built to load fast, adapt smoothly across devices, and
    remain easy to use on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Subtle animations and transitions add polish without slowing
    the experience.
  </p>

  <p style="color:var(--muted);">
    This website is a foundation you can grow. Replace placeholders with real images, refine your service details,
    and expand when needed. The structure is already in place to support a professional brand presence—simple,
    scalable, and built to last.
